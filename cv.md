## Briefly about myself
Hi! I'm a beginner frontend developer. My technical background includes bachelor degree and master's degree in mechanics obtained in my alma mater - Samara State University.

I also spent 10 years of my life in the position of design engineer at a large plant and quit this organization with the position of lead design engineer.  One day I realized the need to move forward and began to study JavaScript as a part of the course "JavaScript/Front-end" in RSSchool.

But then something went wrong, and I became an analyst.

Now I'm looking for opportunities to brush up on front-end development techniques.
